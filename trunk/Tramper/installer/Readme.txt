Introduction

Thank you for downloading this release of Tramper, your Internet player. This is still 
a beta version, so a bit buggy.


System Requirements

This software require a Java Runtime Environment (JRE(TM)) 1.5 or more on your system to run properly.
It has been tested on Windows XP, Linux Fedora core 6 and Macos X.
A valid sound system is obviously required.

If the installer didn't create shortcuts, you can launch Tramper by 
double-clicking <install-rep>/lib/Tramper.jar file
or typing the following command : java -jar <install-rep>/lib/Tramper.jar
